Hard-partying star off drink - Lindsay Lohan Joins Alcoholics Anonymous, By The Telegraph Online in Lohan  ,  3/12/2006 ,"Los Angeles, Dec. 2 (Reuters): Actress Lindsay Lohan, who has been a frequent target of the tabloids for her partying ways, has begun attending Alcoholics Anonymous meetings, her publicist said yesterday.“It’s positive and she hopes the press leaves her alone,” publicist Leslie Sloane-Zelnik said of the 20-year-old star, whose penchant for parties and nightclubs have made her the focus of tabloid stories portraying the auburn-haired actress as out of control.In July, a producer of the film Georgia Rule blamed Lohan’s “hard partying” for a series of late arrivals and absences from the set that her spokeswoman said was due to illness. In a 2005 article in Vanity Fair, Lohan admitted to having an eating disorder, but later denied her statements. "
Centre helps addicts tide over bottle blues - Alcoholics Anonymous celebrates one year of success in steel city, By ANTARA BOSE ,  21/08/2013 ,"A peg every day keeps the doctor away, so goes the saying. But for many, these pegs too many often end up ruining their lives just like it happened in the case of 57-year-old Sayantan Das (named changed), who binged daily on beer. However, Das is reformed now, having turned from a social outcast to a successful family man, thanks to Alcoholics Anonymous’s year-long efforts.The centre, which functions from Loyola School premises in Jamshedpur, is a wing of the international organisation found in 1935. It completed a year on Tuesday and hosted a small get-together on the cradle premises to spread the message of life. “I started drinking with friends when work took me to Bhilai for two years. I got so hooked to alcohol that my business suffered. Somehow, I went to Calcutta and joined Calcutta Samaritans and quit the drinking habit. However, once I visited Vishakhapatnam, I again started having beer because of the humid weather. The addiction soon grew out of control. After four years, I turned to Alcoholics Anonymous that helped me overcome the habit,” Das smiled, adding that it had been a year since he left drinking.Till date, Alcoholics Anonymous has been able to help 10 addicts stop drinking and lead a happy life. Like them, 25 more are in the process of kick the habit and are attending counselling sessions. The sessions are held every Tuesday and Saturday. As of now, the centre conducts a story-sharing session, where people are motivated to lead a happy social life with self-control. It also helps the reformed people get engaged with NGOs.“People feel that they can get out of their misery once they are down two pegs. But, instead they should concentrate on meditation that helps the mind settle down. We try to make them comfortable here and talk about the better and beautiful things in life. After all, it is a disease,” said Jaya Moitra, a counsellor at Alcoholics Anonymous.She also thanked actor Aamir Khan. “I always wanted to do something like this, but had no clue how to go about it. I called up the helpline number that flashed during Satyamev Jayate and it was Aamir Khan who gave me the contacts so that I could start this centre.” "
Kids learn to peg away at parents?alcoholism - Organisation affiliated to Alcoholics Anonymous encourages children to help addicts kick the habit, By Staff Reporter in Guwahati  ,  11/08/2005 ,"Guwahati, Aug. 11: At an age when most children face no bigger crisis in life than having to drink the large glass of milk that their mothers thrust on them everyday, five-year-old Rakesh Baruah is having to deal with a father who drinks too much alcohol for his family?s good.Last week, Rakesh (named changed) and seven other students of different schools in Guwahati came together to form a group called Alateen, affiliated to Alcoholics Anonymous, in a bid to learn how to wean their parents away from alcohol dependence.On Sundays and other holidays, the group will meet to share their experiences and learn how to overcome the trauma of living with alcoholic parents. ?We are all from the same background and with similar problems. I hope we will be able to help each other out,? Rakesh said with the maturity of a much older child.His friend Alakesh echoed him. ?We are just making a beginning. Hopefully, we will be able to change the way our parents lead their lives, and for the better.?Alcoholics Anonymous is a US-based organisation that has been helping alcoholics and substance abusers around the world kick the habit and rehabilitate themselves through cathartic interactive sessions. As the name suggests, Alcoholics Anonymous is about addicts helping themselves, while Alateen is for children from families devastated by alcoholism. Alateen was formed on the 10th anniversary of Al-Anon (Northeast), which has been helping family members of alcoholics cope with the common crisis in their lives.?There is an alarming increase in the number of schoolchildren suffering because of alcoholic parents. Alateen will be able to help these children in many ways,? June P, co-founder of Al-Anon and Alateen in Calcutta, told The Telegraph.June, 75, said members of Al-Anon?s Northeast chapter had been successful in reforming hundreds of alcoholics. She was here last week to attend the anniversary celebrations of Al-Anon.?We treat alcoholism as a disease. Those who are suffering need care and attention. If you abuse an alcoholic, he or she will not change. Family members and children play the pivotal role in reforming alcoholics with love and caring,? she said.Jahnabi B, a city-based lawyer, said her decision to join Al-Anon led to ?a miracle?.?My husband was an alcoholic. I was frustrated with life and that also led to friction between us. But things changed as soon as I joined Al-Anon. When I started sharing my experiences with other Al-Anon members, I got the strength to bear with my husband?s habit and started giving him the necessary care,? she said.Jahnabi?s husband is now an ?occasional drinker?.Arup Bhattacharyya, founder of Alcoholics Anonymous in Guwahati, now manages a shelter for addicts, Resurrection Home, at Bonda. ?I was an alcoholic. But Alcoholics Anonymous and my wife helped me overcome this disease. The love and care of family members can do wonders. You must know how to behave with alcoholics,? he said."
"Staying afloat, away from the liquor - Alcoholics Anonymous draws up meet-and-act agenda to beat the bottle", By NISHA LAHIRI ,  20/02/2003 ,"“Hi. I’m Alex. I’m an alcoholic and I am a member of Alcoholics Anonymous (AA),” are his words of introduction. About seven years ago, he was “a complete drunk with no hope. The doctors had given up on me. I had severe tremors, about 45 per cent of my liver was damaged by cirrhosis and I weighed about 39 kg. Whatever I ate I threw up violently, along with raw blood, and I was drunk 24 hours a day.”That was when he turned to AA for support. For Alex (name changed on request), the biggest achievement is returning to a degree of normalcy. “Because, with alcoholism, the family and friends of the alcoholic, too, are affected. Guilt, shame and the tension of not knowing whether your husband or father is going to be dumped like a sack of potatoes by a rickshaw-wallah on your doorstep, or spend the night in jail. The stigma exists because most people don’t know that alcoholism is a disease of the obsessive-compulsive kind with a genetic predisposition, and is so recognised by the World Health Organisation and the Indian Medical Association, amongst others,” he adds.Working with doctors, psychiatrists, nursing homes, detoxification centres, the police, the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC), the district magistrate and other district officers, AA is intent on spreading the word, “to just let people know we are there”, in the 20th year of it’s existence in Calcutta. “At AA, we are just a bunch of drunks helping each other to stop reaching for the bottle,” smiles Alex. “It’s impossible to do it alone.” At the moment, there are about 11 groups with around 500 members in the city, with an average of three meetings in one day, and anyone welcome to attend.The next project, for which the paperwork has been finalised, is to work with inmates of city jails, for which 10 volunteers, “recovering alcoholics” of AA, have been lined up. The aim is to change the mindset of society and help those who have been written off by everyone. More plans are on the drawing board to work with the CMC, and sensitisation of the police.It is to talk about these and other issues that the members of AA are gathering at the Seva Kendra on February 22 and 23 for the 4th National Service Conference. “Last year, the mayor had attended, and promised us his full support, claiming that a lot of CMC employees were suffering from this problem,” Alex says. “This year, there will be delegates from all over the country, particularly veterans from Mumbai, sharing their vast storehouse of knowledge.” There will be two sections a day, with a lecture and then a session for the 80-odd participants to share their experiences. “Alcoholism is a chronic, life-long problem. We just want to let people know there is help at hand,” Alex sums up."
Masked & anonymous, By Unknown authors make Chandrima S. Bhattacharya wonder about their influences on our lives ,  12/09/2007 ,"I was thinking the other day of the influence Anonymous has had on my life. It’s not that I noticed him before the third or fourth grade, when I think I came across the first poems written by him. At poetry contests, there would invariably be some offerings “by Anonymous”. But these were instances in which the man was credited for his works. There were so many of his creations that held me absolutely in thrall since very early. My childhood would have been impossible without him. The first rhyme (though, I believe, it’s not a canonical one) that I learnt was: “Miss Molly had a dolly/ Who was sick, sick, sick/ So she called for the doctor and/ Asked him to be quick, quick, quick.” This, to the immense pleasure of spectators all around me, I would perform with the aid of a plastic “doctor’s set”, to the accompaniment of “action”. I am sure this early act of mine goes a long way towards explaining the many strange things that I went on to do later in life, but I was actively encouraged into the nursery rhyme by my teachers and family. I am also quite sure that I am not alone in this. What would Bengali childhood be without the informing presence of English nursery rhymes, all written by the said Anonymous? How many of us have not had to also recite “Baa Baa Black Sheep, Have you any wool?” with a shake of the head and a thrust of the three fingers? How many of us have not felt bewildered by Humpty Dumpty’s fate? What had he done to deserve such a fate, breaking into such small pieces? Was he an instrument of Evil punished ruthlessly by the Unseen Hand? And Little Miss Muffet? Her trauma was ours. It was only later that we realised that the spider was really a metaphor of a virulent masculine sexuality breaking into the blameless world of a small virgin — and not just a spider. The stories of Cinderella, of The Beauty and the Beast and Little Red Riding Hood — all these had deep political meanings, Little Red Riding Hood being an elaboration of the Miss Muffet plot, which is why they all had such a powerful grip on young minds. Anonymous was quite scary. But when it came to Bengali, except the alphabet rhymes that started with -e Ojogor, most rhymes and poetry and fairy tales that I read in my childhood could have been traced to names, mostly to Tagore. From Sahaj Path to Birpurush, that most inspiring poem about how a child defends his mother on a most perilous journey — and I became him, of course — almost everything that I read and loved in Bengali as a child was written by Tagore. Even Thakumar Jhuli was attributed to an author with a long, difficult name — Dakshinaranjan Mitra Majumdar — and I would have a tough time trying to match his portrait in the book with the picture that I had of my grandmothers. And the ancient rhymes that we heard — Aye aye chandmama or Dol dol duluni — were not really children’s; they were meant for elders to sing to children. Hardly anything was anonymous. Maybe because the anonymous author of the Indian languages was busy with bigger things — like collaborating on the epics. He was really into the adult imagination. For though Ramayana and Mahabharata are attributed to the sages Valmiki and Ved Vyas respectively, there is a suspicion that many, many unnamed other people wrote it. As they wrote some of the other biggest works of literature in the world: The Bible and The Arabian Nights. The tradition continues in Bengali. There is a piece called Mahayana, which is still being written and available in different versions. Originating in a Calcutta campus, which, no one is quite sure about, Mahayana is a collection of Bengali shlokas, brilliant takes on the underground lives of the Ramayana and Mahabharata characters. But not one can be published as they are very subversive and somewhat unprintable. However, after Ram Gopal Varma Ki Aag, Ram Gopal Varma must be wishing he was Anonymous. But it’s difficult to hide such a long name — and a swollen head.         chandrima@abpmail.com"
Cops hot on trail of anonymous caller, By Joy Sengupta ,  13/09/2016 ,"Police are trying to trace the anonymous caller who gave a false alert to the police control room last week on a liquor party at the residence of Abhijit Bhattacharya, the chief postmaster at the Patna General Post Office (GPO).Sources at the police headquarters said on Monday that senior police officers had ordered the search. They added that the station house officer (SHO) of SK Puri police station had been directed to act immediately setting aside all other work and catch the man as fast as possible.Patna senior superintendent of police (SSP) Manu Maharaaj said: ""Whatever happened was wrong and I have already issued an order to all the SHOs to ensure that whenever any information comes to them from any source or the police control room which needs a raid, they should take into confidence the deputy superintendent of police (DSP) and superintendent of police (SP) in charge. Such mistakes shouldn't be repeated. And the person who gave the false information to the police will be arrested soon. The SHO acted on information which came to him from the control room but he needed to verify it first.""The raid at Bhattacharya's rented accommodation was carried late on September 5 evening.A team led by SK Puri police station SHO Sanjay Verma stormed the house and searched it for almost half-an-hour. However, no liquor was recovered and the police left red-faced.Chief postmaster Bhattacharya later said he felt humiliated at the raid.""The police have orders to nab the anonymous caller. The higher-ups in the department and the government are not happy at all with the action. The call has been tracked to Masaurhi on the outskirts of Patna and a team of SK Puri police station led by its SHO has been despatched this (Monday) afternoon. Instructions have been given to the team to take help from the Masaurhi police and track him down on a priority basis. We hope that he will be caught shortly after which the police will quiz him about his motives,"" said another police officer, preferring anonymity.The incident has exposed the vulnerability of people falling for false allegations. The department of posts had too severely criticised the incident. ""It is a serious issue, and we are going to take up the matter with the state,"" Adnan Ahmed, the director of postal services (headquarters) in Patna, had said.""We are also going to seek details on how and why the raids were initiated and whether somebody from our department had complained to the police. The matter has also been informed to the Union ministry of communications,"" Ahmed had added.When Ahmed was contacted on Monday, he said: ""I am not aware of the latest developments as I am on leave.""Sources told The Telegraph that the chief minister's secretariat was also concerned and orders had been issued for the same to the state police headquarters."
Anonymous calls threaten England, By The Telegraph Online ,  26/01/2003 ,"London, Jan. 25 (Reuters): England’s cricket team have received anonymous letters threatening violence if they travel to Zimbabwe for the World Cup.England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) chairman David Morgan said the team received the threats at their hotel earlier this week in Sydney, the BBC’s website reported on Saturday. The letters warned of violent consequences, including riots and disturbances before and during the game, if England travelled to Zimbabwe. Nasser Hussain’s team play the home side in Harare on February 13.Morgan said he had been told of the letters by Hussain and that the enthusiasm of the 15-man squad to play in Zimbabwe was diminishing. World Cup executive director Ali Bacher said the letters should be treated with suspicion. “In South Africa over the years I have received many anonymous threatening letters,” Bacher said. “Most people don’t put a name to them. I’ve never gone to the police and I’m still around today.”England and Australia have resisted calls from their governments to boycott matches in Zimbabwe.However, following a review of security arrangements there, ICC chief executive Malcolm Speed said the board decided there was “no reason on grounds of safety and security to relocate the matches scheduled to be played in Zimbabwe”.

Drop-in centres for alcoholics, By Staff Reporter ,  19/09/2004 ,"Sept. 19: Alcoholics in the city now have a new address to come for treatment. Navajiwan, a drug de-addiction centre, has set up a drop-in for addicts near Sahitya Sabha Bhawan. It will act as a recreational and counselling centre for the addicts.The centre will also look after intravenous drug users.Navajiwan had earlier planned to open a centre only for the injected drug users at Manipuri Basti in the city but later included counselling for alcoholics. Unofficial sources put the figure of active drug users in the city at 10,000 though very few have registered with the three de-addiction centres till June this year. In the last five years, there has been a 15 to 20 per cent increase in the number of drug users in the city.The centre will provide information on first-aid and referral, harm reduction or minimisation, needle sharing, preventive measures and HIV-AIDS. It will also impart training on yoga, art of living and process of socialisation.H.K. Bharadwaj, in charge of the centre, said drug users feel that they are being rejected by their family members and the society, which encourage them to inject more doses.The drop-in centre will have ?peer educators? who are recovering addicts under the guidance and supervision of Navajiwan."
Art Anonymous, By Swachchhasila Basu ,  20/05/2018 ,"Victoria Memorial's Albert Hall. The last day of April. A talk titled ""19th Century Swadeshi Art in Bengal: woodcuts, woodblocks and lithographs"". The discourse and the documentary screening preceding it are distillations from an exhibition underway at Victoria Memorial and curated by artist Ashit Paul. The show will travel to the National Museum, Delhi, soon.Paul had also put together another 19th century art show in Delhi last year, but that focused on rare oil, oleographs, litho paintings and prints of the pre-Bengal School.That day at Victoria Memorial, when the documentary started to play, it was the content that followed the colon in the title to his talk - woodcuts, woodblocks, etc. - that seemed to occupy screen space.A fortnight later at his residence in southwest Calcutta, Paul tells The Telegraph, ""My focus has been woodcuttings - illustrations, advertisements, and ads and illustrations of gods and goddesses in panjikas (almanacs) - from the mid-19th century to the early 20th century.""But we were more intrigued by the ""swadeshi"" bit. What did he mean by swadeshi art? Patriotic art?Not necessarily, says Paul, and launches into a bit of art history. ""Till the mid-19th century, the only school of art in Bengal was the Kalighat ' pat' art. Knowledge of the art form was passed down from one generation to another in artists' families. Other artists would imitate British themes and techniques. Wood and metal engraving were already being used by the British. In 1816, the first Bengali book with illustrations, Annanda Mangal, was published. It had two metal carvings and three woodcut illustrations, but we find only one artist attribution, Ramchand Roy. Here is a native author, a local story, a native publisher, a native illustrator, nothing British. So this art is 'swadeshi' in that sense, too.""According to Paul, woodcutting was not a traditional art form. He says, ""The technique was used in the sari industry, but its evolution as an art form was entirely need-based. Publishers felt the need to illustrate books. And woodcutters were trained for the task.""He talks about how the pat artists eventually graduated to making litho prints and filling in colours to meet evolving demands. ""It dawned on the woodcutters that they, too, dealt in outlines (which is what the litho prints were about). So, instead of limiting themselves to carving for book illustrations, they could carve on larger blocks of wood and reproduce copies for commercial gain. Thus came large display pictures - and they found place of pride in the homes of babus. These illustrations dealt primarily with social issues and satires, especially on the ' babu' culture. This transition was not conditioned or through training. So it was 'swadeshi' in that way, too.""Paul hands us a booklet published by Vic-toria Memorial Hall in collaboration with Akar Prakar, the Calcutta-based art gallery. It has images of prints, some coloured, mostly black-and-white. Some of the most eye-catching ones - with titles such as Lobster with Fish, Cat with Lobster - come sans artist names.We keep flipping the pages - advertisements, lithographic prints. The last category shows some fairly elaborate drawings. There is one that is apparently of Shiv, rays emanating from his third eye and a serpent tangled in his dreadlocks. Behind him there is an embracing couple and a kneeling woman. One can see the Himalayas in the background and a couple of coniferous trees and behind them a youth with a flowery bow. It is titled The Oriental Cupid in Flames and dated 1878. Yet again no artist credit, but it does say Calcutta Art Studio.Paul tells us that the Calcutta Art Studio was established in 1878 by Annadaprasad Bagchi and two others - all products of the Art School, which is now known as the Government College of Art and Craft. This was the first Indian studio in this part of the country. ""Bagchi's motto was that though I have learnt from the British, I shall work with Indian motifs and styles,"" says Paul.The studio provided the nouveau Art graduates the opportunity to print their works, make them easily available. But what of all those anonymous artists? Was their anonymity an accident or someone's design?Says Paul, ""As far as swadeshi art is concerned, I don't yet have an answer to that. Patuas never signed their scrolls or mentioned the place of production, they still don't. It's different with woodcutting, though. Blocks usually have names of carvers engraved but that doesn't necessarily mean they were also the designers of those pictures. They were, in fact, catering to the requirements of the authors or publishers.""And, then, there was rampant plagiarism. ""I have found a picture of Durga, along with the name of the engraver, in one edition of a panjika of a particular publisher. The same image appears in another panjika but with a different attribution,"" says Paul. Not all of it was the doing of plagiarists though; many a time it was about plates being stolen from a printing press and landing up with others.Paul talks about another possibility too. ""Say four or five panjikas were being printed at one particular press. The printer or the manager of the press would use the same image in two or more of them arbitrarily. I have also come across pictures that had appeared in some panjika or the other being used to illustrate Barna Parichay kind of children's books. What mattered more was the appeal of the picture, not who the maker was."""
Join up the jolly good fellows - Support group for alcoholics records membership spurt, By Staff Reporter ,  13/11/2003 ,"Eight-year-olds join, as do those well into their 80s. Around one-third of all members are women. Total numbers across the world are well over two million. And that is just the tip of the iceberg.These figures are a few of the basics of the Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) fellowship. According to the World Health Organisation, there are around 140 million alcoholics in the world. In India alone, in the past three years, 200 new groups have been formed, putting the number of chapters at 700.To further awareness about this disease, global chairman of the organisation’s general services board in New York, Elaine McDowell, and general manager Greg M. attended a seminar on Saturday, organised by the local chapter of AA, in association with the Indian Medical Association, at the Ramakrishna Mission Seva Pratishthan.“There is a rich fellowship in Calcutta,” says Greg (As an AA member, his identity is confidential, though non-alcoholic functionaries of the organisation need not be protected). The rise in numbers, he feels, is due to more people seeking help for their problem, rather than an increase in victims of alcoholism. There are an estimated 100,000 groups in 150 countries, speaking 70 languages, though most are in the United States and Canada, where the body was formed over 60 years ago.The 12-step programme for an AA member starts with the acknowledgement that one is “powerless” when it comes to alcohol and that one’s life has become unmanageable because of it. The “desire” to stop drinking is the only pre-condition to membership.Much of the organisation’s work has succeeded because of the support of medical and allied professionals. “If they are aware of the problems, they can really be of help,” says McDowell, a non-alcoholic who is AA’s first woman chairperson.At Saturday’s interactive session, one main concern surfaced: How does one convince an alcoholic to seek help? Being a supportive friend, access to proper medical counsel and linkages with an existing AA member were a few of the possible means discussed. In Calcutta, Al-Anon, an organisation for family and friends of alcoholics, and Alateen, children of alcoholics, also exist as support structures for those whose lives have been affected by the drinking problem of a loved one."
"WHEN IN SHAME, BLAME 'ANONYMOUS' ", By FROM DEBASHIS BHATTACHARYYA in Mumbai  ,  4/10/2001 ,
Anonymous letter leaves Vyas cold, By OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT in Delhi  ,  27/12/2005 ,"New Delhi, Dec. 27: Reacting to the Sanjay Joshi sex scandal, National Commission for Women chairperson Girija Vyas has said her organisation cannot take action on the basis of an anonymous letter supposedly sent by a woman levelling sexual exploitation charges against the BJP leader.“I have not received the letter but have heard about it through media reports,” Vyas said. The letter is signed “peedit kanya” (traumatised girl) and carries no postal address.Written in Hindi, it was sent to journalists and political bigwigs in the BJP. “I am a humiliated, exploited woman who is begging you for help,” the anonymous author pleads. “A leader, well-known in politics, has destroyed me and sexually exploited me. This leader takes pride in his status of a celibate bachelor. This ‘brahmachari neta’ (celibate leader) is a debauch. “He is educated and wallows in luxury. He has sexually abused me. I am sending with the letter evidence of his crime. The condom I am sending will give you proof of the crime committed. This is the condom he has used to sexually exploit me,” the author adds.“The name of this celibate brahmachari is Sanjay Joshi, general secretary, BJP, 11 Ashoka Road, New Delhi 1. He is a rapist masquerading as a brahmachari. He should be hanged. I would like you to do a DNA test of the condom. This will expose the crime,” the letter says. “If I commit suicide I will not be able to send this evidence and punish the criminal.” “I am a woman and still have the rest of my life before me. I am scared of being stigmatised. Please help me. Hang this pretentious brahmachari of the BJP and save other women from him,” the author says.The supposed victim also reposes full faith in Vyas. “I have absolute confidence in your courage and your sense of justice,” the letter says.But Vyas’s hands are tied. “We do take up such cases of exploitation. But how can we take action when the letter has no name or address. We would have investigated the matter even if the author had contacted us on the phone or a third party had approached us on her behalf,” Vyas said. “It often happens that the person is scared to write. Then she can talk to us on the phone. But we must have something to proceed on.”"

App-cab Anonymous, By Kinsuk Basu ,  2/09/2016 ,"The state transport authority suspects that app-cab aggregator Ola hasn't been running a background check on drivers before allowing them on its online platform.""We do not have the antecedents of the accused (Ola driver Guddu Singh) in the rape and murder of a 12-year-old girl on Wednesday. We suspect the company does not probe a driver's background,"" a senior transport department official told Metro on Thursday.Ola received a temporary licence to operate in Bengal as an app cab company in June. ""Since then, the information that Ola has been sharing with the transport department about the cars and drivers on its platform hasn't usually included the antecedents of the drivers,"" the official said.The state transport authority has written to Ola seeking ""details"" of the drivers who kidnapped the 12-year-old girl from a Brabourne Road pavement, raped and killer her in the app-cab and then dumped the body in a canal in Tiljala.Ola has a week to respond.Guddu, the driver of the Tata Indigo registered with Ola, had been out on bail since being arrested in October 2013 for allegedly robbing a woman at gunpoint. A background check on Guddu would have revealed that he has a pending criminal case against his name, disqualifying him from driving an app cab.His alleged accomplice Shankar Shaw is a private driver having no known association with Ola, although the transport authority has sought information from the company about him as well. The letter to Ola, dated August 31, seeks to know ""detailed steps"" taken by the company ""towards verification of the drivers antecedents as required in the guidelines"".The guidelines in question were notified in December 2015 and must be followed to operate in Bengal as an app-cab company or aggregator. One of the prerequisites is that app-cab operators would verify the antecedents of each driver ""through any registered/accredited security agency"".Ola refuted the charge that it does not run a background check on drivers. ""An agency verifies the antecedents of drivers on our behalf. The agency had cleared the said driver (Guddu),"" an Ola official said on Thursday.To verify criminal records, an agency needs to approach the local police station, which would forward the file to Lalbazar, the city police headquarters.Officers across police stations said they hadn't received any query from any agency seeking to verify the antecedents of app-cab drivers. Lalbazar too said no such file had been forwarded.Metro spoke to several drivers on the Ola platform on Thursday and the majority of them said they had neither been asked any question about their background nor about pending court cases while enrolling for app-cab duty.""I was asked to turn up with my driving licence and all documents relating to the vehicle for an interview in a mall near the Park Circus seven-point crossing,"" said a driver, residing at New CIT Road. ""I was also asked to submit my PAN card. But no questions were asked about my background,"" said the 40-year-old from Sasaram, Bihar.DRIVER DUO IN DANGER LANE Guddu Singh, 22Shankar Shaw, 20 "

Curing an obsession with drinks - CIP has a special cell to treat alcoholics, By The Telegraph Online ,  19/01/2005 ,"It all started with a harmless drink for Rahul. After all it was his best friend?s wedding and though a teetotaller, he could make an exception for this one occasion, reasoned the young professional. The wedding over, it was back to work for him. But now he no longer flinched at the invitation to join his colleagues for a drink after office hours.He felt a lot more relaxed and carefreeafter consuming alcohol and his colleagues were also pleasantly surprised with the new Rahul. His wife, Rimi, was not too happy, but every time she complained, Rahul would whine, ?It?s just three pegs of rum darling and that too once a week?. Unfortunately, the two pegs increased to three and then to four and soon, he himself lost count of the alcohol he was consuming. From an occasional drink over the week-end, it soon became a daily habit. He spent less and less time at home and his wife complained even more vociferously at his irresponsible behaviour. He found her unreasonable and she thought he was intolerable. They screamed and quarelled till his wife walked out of the messy marriage. Rahul started drinking even more.His parents finally persuaded him to consult a doctor who advised treatment for alcoholism. But Rahul refused to accept that he was an alcoholic. Rahul?s parents consulted a psychiatrist, who said that it has been seen that an alcoholic never likes to admit that he has become a slave to alcohol. ?If one comes to terms with the hard fact then the battle is half won,? said the doctor to Rahul?s parents. Rahul?s is no isolated case. There are thousands like him who suffer from alcoholism, which means that one has no control over his urge to consume alcohol and one who does not know when to stop. Alcoholics therefore can beg, borrow and steal, or kill in some cases, to pay for their drink. The obsession gets so overwhelming that it affects the nervous system as well as general health.A man?s ability to consume alcohol and still remain in his senses , doctors point out, is no indication that he is not an alcoholic. Indeed some people get drunk after consuming two pegs of a drink while others behave normally even after consuming five pegs. But the thumb rule is that a regular intake of three or more pegs is described as alcoholism.Alcohol itself , if taken in small doses and sparingly, can be therapeutic, points out Dr Arya Pranay Chaitanya of the Rajendra Institute of Medical Sciences ( RIMS). According to doctors, to understand alcoholism one needs to understand certain related terms such as tolerance, withdrawal, abuse, dependence and intoxication. ?Alcohol tolerance implies that with repeated consumption of alcohol, larger and larger amounts of the intoxicant is required to get the desired effect. If earlier a person used to feel satisfied with two pegs, the requirement will increase to three or four pegs,? says Debrath Kumar, a psychologist with the Central Institute of Psychiatry (CIP) Ranchi. Interestingly, an alcoholic can develop behavioural tolerance which allows him to continue with his job effectively. Somewhat different from the concept of alcohol dependence is the concept of alcohol abuse in which a person impairs his social, inter-personal and occupational functioning. Alcohol dependence is a condition in which a person enters into a state of delirium if he cannot consume alcohol when his body craves for the intoxicant. ?The human body gets attuned to alcohol after regular period of use. The body then starts reacting if the person does not consume alcohol,? said P. K. Choudhary, a psychiatrist with the Davis Institute of Neuro Psychiatry.Addiction to alcohol can cause damage to neurons in certain areas of brain. It can give rise to cardio-vascular, gastro-intestinal problems, and at times even causes cancer (mostly of the liver). Similarly the psychological effect of alcohol is also damaging. It can lead to irritation, depression and in certain cases can cause severe psychiatric disorders. Since alcoholics at times become unsocial, severe psychiatric disorders arise when their loved ones begin to ignore them. Another problem is that they neglect their diet. ?Vitamin B1 deficiency is observed in most alcoholics. This leads to memory loss and in severe cases it causes delirium,? says Arya.Doctors prescribe sedatives in chronic alcohol addiction cases. ?Various psychological therapies as well as pharmacological agents are used to help people overcome this problem. The Central Institute of Psychiatry (CIP) in Ranchi has a separate unit to treat people with this problem. We concentrate on everything from a person?s psychological behaviour to his diet during the programme,? says Debrath.During alcohol withdrawal reactions, the human body witnesses metabolical changes. The patient may experience convulsions, cramps and he/she may also faint during the treatment period. Signs of improvement can be observed in 15 to 45 days of treatment. ?An intense supportive therapy is required during these stages. People may require longer periods of treatment in severe cases of alcohol addiction. Whatever be the case it is curable if the patient has the will to give it up,? says Chowdhary.S. Shekhar"
Fine Print 20-06-2006, By The Telegraph Online ,  20/06/2006 ,"Anonymous Depp New York, June 19 (AP): Johnny Depp says the media’s perception of him as a European wannabe has been exaggerated, and that he just likes the anonymity of living in France. this week’s issue of Newsweek, the 43-year-old actor says life is simpler there. “I’ve always loved it there,” he said. “The phones don’t ring as much. Movies are never brought up in conversation. I’ll take the kids and we’ll go out to the trampoline and the swing set, and we’ll stop by the garden and see how our tomatoes are doing. You know, old-fart stuff. Good stuff.” It’s a sharp contrast to his early acting days when he became a teen idol starring on the TV series 21 Jump Street. “Suddenly, you go into restaurants and people are pointing at you and whispering, he said. “You feel spooked by it because that freedom of anonymity is gone. You never get used to that. ”Depp, French actress-singer Vanessa Paradis and their two children split their time between homes in France and Los Angeles. Bracing for baby boom Sydney (Reuters): Australian hospitals are bracing for a baby boom in July as expectant mothers try to delay imminent births to take advantage of a new welfare payment, researchers said on Monday. From July 1, a baby bonus paid to the parents for every new-born child will increase by A$1,000 ($740) to A$4,000. Economists said that after the baby bonus was introduced in July 2004 about 700 births were delayed by a week to take advantage of the new payment."
"At NMCH, yoga to kick the bottle", By Shuchismita Chakraborty ,  16/04/2016 ,"The state government has roped in the services of a yoga expert at the Nalanda Medical College and Hospital (NMCH) de-addiction centre to help alcoholics deal with withdrawal symptoms.Alcoholics at the centre are being put through a one-and-a- half-hour long yoga session every morning by Varun Kumar Yogi (33), who earlier worked at a yoga centre in Muzaffarpur. Varun has rendered his services at the de-addiction centre for three days now and patients said they were benefiting from the process.Varun said he was teaching asanas to both the patients and their attendants.""It is not mandatory for attendants to join the session but we are encouraging them to join as well because their help will be important when the patients are released from rehab and maintain routine yoga at home,"" he said. ""As of now, I am teaching three asanas - anulom-vilom, kapalbhati and bhramari - which are mainly breathing exercises. I am not making them do asanas which reduce fat or need heavy physical exercise.""Yogi said the patients were initially unable to follow his instructions but had responded effectively later.""When I instructed them to inhale and exhale for five seconds, some did it for three seconds and some did not even try,"" he said. ""Again, there were some who did it for seven seconds. So, everyone was reacting differently. Concentration levels of the addicts get affected because of their addiction and the problem becomes evident if one quits suddenly. The problem can be addressed with yoga and counselling sessions.""Fifty-five-year-old Bhagwan Thakur is a patient at the centre. He said he had been experiencing trembling in his hands which had improved after he joined the yoga sessions.""My hands don't tremble any more,"" he said. ""The yoga session has really been helpful.""He is accompanied by his wife, Meena Devi, to the sessions. ""I am trying to learn the asanas properly so that I can correct my husband if he goes wrong,"" she said. ""Doctors have told us that yoga will be very helpful for my husband.""Shravan Ram, another patient at the de-addiction centre, said he was a little restless before joining the yoga session but now he was fine.Centre nodal officer Santosh Kumar said the yoga instructor had been engaged on the instruction of principal health secretary R.K. Mahajan. ""Yoga is a wonderful practice for people who are recovering from an addiction,"" he said. ""Drug and alcohol abuse always means that people lose touch with their bodies and minds. Yoga allows them to gain control over their senses and become more comfortable. It can be particularly helpful during the early days of recovery when the patient deals with heavy stress.""The 30-bed de-addiction centre at NMCH now has eight attendants to look after the patients.""We have engaged the attendants because the patients need to be under constant surveillance,"" said Santosh. ""The patients can do risky things.""Yogi Mahesh, a yoga guru at the Bihar School of Yoga who runs a yoga centre in Odisha, said yoga could do wonders for those who were trying to get out of some kind of addiction.""The bhramari asana helps in increasing the concentration of the person who practises it,"" he said. "" One can master meditation techniques in three sittings and only under a good yoga guru. But anulom vilom may not be too beneficial because the addicts will get fed up with all the physical exercise that it requires. ""The de-addiction centre has also equipped its wards with LED televisions, air-conditioners, carrom boards and other facilities to engage the addicts.""Everything runs according to a fixed routine here,"" said Santosh. ""It helps the patients to heal faster."""
Stolen bikes for liquor sale, By Our Special Correspondent in Patna  ,  6/09/2018 ,"Patna: Bootleggers are using stolen motorbikes to deliver bottles of Indian made foreign liquor (IMFL) to alcoholics in dry Bihar.The startling fact came to the fore during interrogation of Mukhlal Choudhary, who was arrested from Wazirganj in Rohtas district on Wednesday. The police seized 12 bags of Rajasthan-made foreign liquor during the operation. Acting on a tip-off, a police team led by Rohtas superintendent of police Satyaveer Singh raided a house at Wazirganj under Sasaram Muffasil police station and arrested Mukhlal Choudhary, an alleged smuggler.Mukhlal, who was in the lucrative trade for the past year, reportedly revealed that stolen two-wheelers were being used to deliver consignments to alcoholics in and around Rohtas district. Five stolen motorbike were seized during the police operation against liquor smugglers. Sasaram sub-divisional police officer Rajesh Kumar said the district police have already appealed to residents to refrain from illegal activities.Those involved in violation of the new prohibition law would be dealt with sternly, he said, adding that such raids would continue.Earlier, SP Satyaveer had asked residents to inform police about sale, consumption and manufacture of liquor in their respective areas. The names of informers would be kept secret, he had told the residents.In June, the police had seized over 544 bags of IMFL worth Rs 1.5 crore from an abandoned truck on the National Highway-30 in Rohtas district on Friday.The truck, bearing a Rajasthan registration number, was found abandoned near Kalaspur village under the jurisdiction of Dinara police station in the district, around 165km southwest of Patna. The driver and cleaner, however, had escaped from the spot."
Free wood for last rites - Anonymous donor foots cremation bills, By VISHVENDU JAIPURIAR ,  25/06/2013 ,"Firewood for cremation will now be given free of cost at Muktidham crematorium, Kheergaon in Hazaribagh, thanks to an anonymous donor. The donor, who doesn’t want to be identified, has deposited an amount with the forest department, which has also been kept under wraps. Now, anyone who approaches Baba Bhutnath Mandali, the outfit that procures wood from forest department godown at Charhi, 15km from Hazaribagh, will get cremation firewood completely free of cost. Mohammad Khalid, of NGO Murda Kalyan Samiti, a social worker known for performing last rites of unclaimed bodies, said the donor asked him to put up signboards in this regard. “Three quintals of biofuel are required to cremate a body and each costs Rs 700. But from now on, no one will have to spend a paisa on firewood at Muktidham,” he said.Even a month earlier, wood was a precious commodity at the crematorium. The forest department hiked the price of wood per quintal to Rs 600 for selling the Mandali, which in turn sold it to the bereaved at the crematorium at Rs 450, running a loss of Rs 150 per quintal. As a result, the Mandali stopped buying wood. In protest of this anomaly, CPM district secretary Ganesh Kumar Singh on May 23 posed as a corpse. Finally, the forest department fixed Rs 700 as the new price. But all that is now in the past. “The crematorium received a large consignment of wood on Friday, June 21, thanks to the benefactor. This is a good start,” Khalid said. Mandali members are also informing kin of the bereaved about the free firewood facility. Khalid said he had also met local officials and donors on kerosene donation. Around 100l of kerosene is needed per month at the crematorium. “We want to provide free kerosene too. Some donors in Hazaribagh are ready to pay for kerosene,” he said."

We have erected cages in several areas and ordered more for other places,” a forest official in Sivasagar district said.Thirty leopards have been captured in the two districts by the forest department in the past year, most of these from human habitats.During the same period, 20 leopards died in human attacks. Several persons were also injured by the animals. The official said these animals are released in reserve forests far away from human settlements after being caged. “We also conduct a thorough medical check on the animals before releasing them,” he said.Anonymous helpline Setting up complaint boxes in schools so that the students can address their grievances with anonymity can go a long way in curbing corporal punishments in schools.This suggestion was among a set of recommendations made by experts during a three-day state consultation on Discipline with Dignity — Promoting Positive Discipline in Schools of Assam held in Guwahati from July 28.Experts, resource persons and others who participated in the consultation organised jointly by Unicef and Law Research Institute of Gauhati High Court, were unanimous on establishing an effective redressal mechanism in schools. They felt it would facilitate direct and effective communication with students and help authorities deal effectively with the menace that is still very much prevalent in the schools of the state.They also emphasised sensitisation of teachers, the community, parents, children and media on child rights, child protection, and corporal punishment. They discussed creating positions of protection officer as the nodal officer to operationalise the system of redressal at district level and as student counsellor at the school level in a bid to do away with corporal punishment in schools.FootnoteSinger Zubeen Garg in now on a new mission. He has decided to create awareness among the people about the diverse tribes living in the region. Garg, with this end in sight, has decided to don traditional outfits of various tribes during his stage performances in India and abroad. Garima Garg, his wife and fashion designer, said they have collected original models of traditional outfits from Arunachal Pradesh, Mizoram and Assam and she is now giving them a modern touch without compromising on their originality. She said the singer would display these outfits in his forthcoming functions in the US, Dubai, South Africa and different parts of India. “A unique feature of the Northeast is its several tribes and their rich traditions. Unfortunately, the rest of India hardly knows anything about the tribes. If Zubeen wears such outfits during his performance he will definitely be able to create an interest and awareness about the tribes. In a few functions where Zubeen wore tribal outfits the audience later came and inquired about the dresses and tribes,” Garima said. Zubeen and Garima recently visited Namphake village in Dibrugarh district. The village is inhabited by Tai Phake, a lesser-known tribe believed to be an offshoot of the Tai race, which entered Assam in the latter half of the 18th century from Yunnan province of China. “We have collected some original designs of Tai Phake. I am trying to give them a modern touch. We will be visiting many other tribal villages in the region,” she added. "
"Miracle pill hope for alcoholics, drug addicts", By The Telegraph Online ,  16/11/2004 ,"New York, Nov. 15 (AP): A pill that helps you lose weight and quit smoking? That was amazing enough to capture headlines last week. But scientists say the experimental drug might be even more versatile, providing a new tool to help people stop abusing drugs and alcohol, too.It?s called Rimonabant, or Acomplia, and last week researchers reported it could help people not only lose weight but keep it off for two years.That burnished the drug?s reputation after two studies in March, which suggested it could fight both obesity and smoking, two of humanity?s biggest killers.The French pharmaceutical firm Sanofi-Aventis plans to seek federal approval for Rimonabant next year. But the drug?s benefits may go beyond just smokers and obese people, researchers say.?I think it?s going to have a big impact on the treatment of addiction,? said Dr. Charles ?Brien, an addiction expert at the university of Pennsylvania and the Philadelphia Veterans Affairs Medical Centre.Animal studies suggest Rimonabant can block the effects of marijuana and fight relapse in alcohol and cocaine abuse, he said. Once it is approved for treating obesity or smoking, ?We?ll be free to study it in these other areas and I?ll try to get my hands on it as quickly as possible,? ?Brien said.He?s not alone in his enthusiasm.The National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism is interested in seeing whether Rimonabant can help treat heavy drinkers, said George Kunos of the institute. No human test results for Rimonabant in alcohol abuse have yet been published, he said."

AA reform spirit key to deaddiction, By OUR CORRESPONDENT in Jamshedpur  ,  18/02/2003 ,"Jamshedpur, Feb. 18: Alcoholic Anonymous is their home for deaddiction. And AA welcomes them.The Alcoholics Anonymous (India) conducted an awareness meeting at the Indigo Block in Loyola School campus today.Some of the former alcoholics narrated the ill-effects of alcoholism. They tried to drive home the point that it brings misery and weakens the body, causing premature death.The audience, mostly former alcoholics, listened to the experiences narrated by the speakers with rapt attention. The experiences presented a true picture about the dark side of alcoholism. Most of the participants who attended today’s awareness programme were from Inter-Club of Kharagpur, while others belonged to the city and Mumbai.Inter-Club is a small group of people who discuss common problems and try to solve them collectively. According to Lawrie F, chairman, Alcoholics Anonymous (India), 60 per cent of the alcoholics who attend their meetings get rid of alcoholism.“Our recovery level is 60 per cent. Alcoholics who had attended the 90-odd meetings of the AA have been successful in getting rid of the habit,” he told The Telegraph.Lawrie added that the instant recovery level was almost 50 per cent.He explained that alcoholics have to take their own initiative and come for the meetings. “The meetings are nothing but sharing of experiences between former alcoholics and those who want to get rid of the habit. The sharing of experiences does help in many ways,” he said.“One gets to understand that we are powerless against alcohol and that it has an overbearing influence on us. Admission (of consuming alcohol) is the main factor leading alcoholic to kick the habit,” he added.Mumbai-based Lawrie said the meetings generally run over a period of three months. “But it can be extended. There is no time limit,” he added.The 12 basic steps to get rid of alcoholism include admission that we are powerless against alcohol, to believe that a power greater than us could restore us to sanity, make a searching and fearless moral inventory of ourselves, he added.

'I call them the 'Secret Seven' - because the first letter was anonymous'," By Bishakha De Sarkar meets Mridula Mukherjee, director of the Nehru Memorial Museum and Library in Delhi, who has been embroiled in a controversy over her continuation as the head of the prestigious institution ",  23/08/2009 ,"Rajnath Singh can afford to smile. The daggers in the quarrelsome Bharatiya Janata Party are nowhere as sharp as the weapons — mainly words and views — that are being employed in the war of all wars. If the BJP chief thinks he’s had a bad week, he should chat up historian Mridula Mukherjee: she’s had a bad year.But the director of the Nehru Memorial Museum and Library (NMML) can now sit back and talk about it — and even laugh an occasional hollow laugh. Her term as the head of an institute that is to the academic world what the Kodak Theatre is to Hollywood has just been extended. The conflict, however, is not yet over. She has won the battle, but the war rages on.“The drama started soon after I was named director in July 2005. Do you know, I joined 13 months after I was appointed? It’s a record. Prevarication and manipulation sought to delay my appointment and if possible prevent it at the level of the bureaucracy,” she says.But for that, we need to delve into the past a bit. For those who came in late, the NMML, set up in 1964 to honour India’s first Prime Minister, started functioning in 1966 as a society. Exactly 40 years later, Mukherjee left Jawaharlal Nehru University, where she had been teaching since 1972, to join the NMML on deputation.The elegant stone and stucco structure, commonly referred to as Teen Murti, stands imperially at one end of Lutyens’s Delhi. The old colonial building — now the museum — is where Nehru lived, and before him, the commander-in-chief of the British army. The 25-acre complex with lush green lawns and tiny fountains reflects all that is well with the world.What it hides is the skullduggery that has been echoing in the solemn corridors of the library for over a year now. Mukherjee believes that the 13-month-long delay in her taking over as director because of bureaucratic glitches is linked to the ongoing campaign against her. “I didn’t know it then. I know now,” she says.The first salvo was fired in February 2008. The then headmaster of Doon School, Kanti Bajpai — one of Mukherjee’s old colleagues from JNU — was merely the missile launcher. He sent a note to NMML’s Exective Council (EC) chairman Karan Singh, saying that he had received a letter expressing concern over the happenings in the library from someone he “respect(s) and trust(s) who wishes to remain anonymous, and that he was forwarding it to him. One month later, he followed it up with another letter to Singh, saying that he was now dispatching a “signed letter” to him. The second letter was initialled by seven respected academics — including Sumit Sarkar and Ramachandra Guha.“I call them the ‘Secret Seven’ — because the first letter was anonymous,” laughs Mukherjee.In little more than a year, the seven had multiplied to 57. In June 2009, a letter was sent to the Prime Minister — who also heads the culture ministry which is the administrative head of the NMML. The signatories included Raj Mohan Gandhi (University of Illinois), Sunil Khilnani (Johns Hopkins University), Partha Chatterjee (Centre for Studies in Social Sciences, Calcutta), Sanjay Subrahmanyam (University of California) and Mushirul Hasan (Jamia Millia Islamia vice-chancellor). It was a veritable list of the Who’s Who of academia, and included the original seven signatories.The letter regretted that the NMML had “rapidly deteriorated in its functioning” in the last few years. The list of complaints was a long one. Since 2006, it had not issued a single publication and had discontinued the “excellent” journal Contemporary India; it had stopped acquiring manuscripts and microfilming newspapers in Indian languages; the morale of the staff was low; and pluralism was being denied. “Whereas once the academic culture of the NMML represented the diversity of scholarly thought and practice across India, now it is hostage to a particular faction of a particular department of a particular university in New Delhi,” it said.Fortunately, the Prime Minister’s eldest daughter is a historian — and she would have been able to explain to him, if he’d asked, that the reference was to what is informally called the Bipan Chandra faction in JNU. Historian Chandra, Mukherjee’s mentor in JNU, is seen in many circles as the leader of the Congress school of history.The letter, Mukherjee believes, was aimed at blocking her extension as NMML director though it had been decided before she joined that she would, if she wished to, stay on till she was 65.“I am only emphasising this because in recent months, to my utter surprise, an attempt has been made to spread disinformation that the retirement age of the NMML director is 60 years — and therefore I could not have got an extension because I will be 60 next year. Every possible trick in the trade was used.”The letter to the Prime Minister did bring up the issue of the end of her term. “Once the present director’s term ends in August, her successor must be chosen through an open, transparent process… Once a new director takes office, he or she must be encouraged by the reconstituted EC to reach out once more to the scholarly community as a whole, thus to restore the NMML’s non-partisan and plural character.”The EC, however, decided to disregard the petitions against Mukherjee, and earlier this month extended her term by another two years.Mukherjee believes that at the root of the campaign against her is an enquiry by the petitions committee of Parliament.“A year before I joined, between February and May 2005, a whole process of selecting fellows had been gone through. Something that happened during that period became the subject of a complaint by a professor who felt he had been wronged by the selections committee.” The NMML was pulled up by the Parliamentary committee, and asked to hold its own enquiry and take action against the officials responsible.An enquiry was ordered. “The then director is no longer under our purview. So what NMML did was suspend the deputy director. The enquiry began. And that’s when the storm broke,” she says.The signatories to the campaign, she believes, may not know the whole truth. “It’s like I am your friend — and you say, ‘You don’t know what that woman is doing in Nehru memorial. She is making a complete mess.’ And I say, ‘Oh really?’ and you say ‘Really, I go there every time.’ And I trust you, and sign up.”But Mukherjee has her share of supporters too. Historian Irfan Habib is with her, and D.N. Jha, also a historian, has sent a letter to the Prime Minister signed by over 100 academics, all reposing their faith in her as the NMML director. Among her other surprising backers are former Election Commissioner James Lyngdoh, conservationist Pradip Krishen and activists Aruna Roy and Medha Patkar. In a detailed letter to the Prime Minister, feminist Madhu Kishwar, a fellow of the Centre for the Study of Developing Societies, has expressed her “deep concern and anguish at the totally unmerited, mala fide unsubstantiated personal attacks against Professor Mridula Mukherjee.”The director — who did her PhD from JNU after studying in Lady Shri Ram College in Delhi — stresses that the allegations had no substance in them. Instead of publishing books, the NMML would rather have professional publishers do the job for it. “I suspended the publication of the journal Contemporary India because it was not first rate — it was of very uneven quality. It had been in place for about five years, and its circulation was down to 20 copies. There were no takers for it.”Contrary to what the petitioners claim, she stresses that she has not been sitting idly either. She has completed a 10-volume publication of the selected works of Jayaprakash Narayan, initiated a digitisation project and a children’s resource centre at the NMML, along with library redesign and refurbishment and museum renovation.Mukherjee, who otherwise speaks almost without breathing as she lists all that she has done for the library, pauses for a moment when asked to comment on allegations that she had opened the NMML doors to the Youth Congress, a body not quite known for its intellectual content.“Everybody enjoys this political linkages thing,” she says. “But I have not done a single programme in collaboration with the Congress, or any organisation associated with the Congress. We have done collaborative programmes with many other organisations close to other political parties, but with the Congress we haven’t. I am not saying if we had it would be a crime. I am merely stating it as a fact. The Youth Congress is not a banned organisation. If they want to book our hall to hold a meeting, and not a rally, they can.”She points out that the NMML has been hired by embassies. Arun Shourie of the BJP and ex-Congressman Natwar Singh made use of the library in recent times. Earlier this week, Jaswant Singh’s book on M.A. Jinnah was released at the NMML by its publishers who hired one of its halls. In less than two days, of course, Jaswant Singh had been expelled from the BJP. Whoever said the NMML was inactive?"

Drinking problem? Help is at hand, By Staff Reporter ,  1/04/2013 ,"March 31: If you have a craving for alcohol then you might be heading up a slippery slope. Often, just a bad habit turns into alcoholism, which is actually a disease that slowly consumes your life.Alcoholics Anonymous, an international fellowship of recovering alcoholics, is holding a training programme on Alcoholism and Domestic Workers at the Centre for Development Initiatives in the city from April 1 to 5. Here, they will share their personal experiences of batting the bottle and emerging victorious. They will also hold a public awareness meeting at a church in Ulubari. During the training programme, around 25 Christian missionaries will also be trained on ways to help alcoholics. “We will conduct a five-day training programme where we will highlight how alcoholism can destroy a person’s life. And since nuns have always been involved in social service, about 25 of them will be trained on how to help alcoholics. One has to realise that alcoholism is a disease and an alcoholic needs help to give up his addiction,” said Dhanjit D, a member of Alcoholics Anonymous. “We will also hold a public awareness meeting on the premises of a church in Ulubari where we will interact with the public and tell them our experiences of how we battled alcoholism. The main problem in the city is that many alcoholics do not seek help for de-addiction, fearing that their identities will be revealed. Many also do not know where to go for help,” Dhanjit said.Alcoholic Anonymous members claim addicts always find an excuse to drink. Many get admitted to hospitals to try and quit but soon return to their old ways. While medical treatment helps to manage physical allergies, it is one’s own determination that is actually required to fight the mental obsession for alcohol. “We have also chosen the topic of domestic workers as we have witnessed that domestic workers in general come from poor families that have been affected by alcoholism. There are many domestics in the city who have to sustain their families by doing household chores in other people’s homes as their husbands squander away their earnings on alcohol. Many of these women are also victims of domestic violence,” Dhanjit added."
CHECKLIST, By The Telegraph Online ,  9/05/2005 ," Stem cells can usher in cancerTwo new studies reported by the New Scientist dampens enthusiasm over the potential of stem cells as cure-alls. They show that even stem cells taken from adults can turn cancerous if they are allowed to multiply for too long outside the body. Researchers have long known that there is a cancer risk with stem cells extracted from very early embryos. Until they change into more specialised tissue, they can form aggressive cancers called teratomas when injected into animals. Until now it has been widely assumed that adult stem cells, such as those taken from bone marrow, do not form cancers. But the latest studies by researchers in Spain and Denmark suggest that adult stem cells are safe only if the number of times they are allowed to divide outside the body is limited. Spinach bad for seniors Folate, or folic acid, a common ingredient in multivitamins, may be linked to faster mental deterioration in older people, even at the recommended doses. Researchers at the Rush University Medical Center in Chicago found that older people who took folic acid supplements at or above the recommended daily allowance of 400 micrograms had a faster rate of mental decline than others their age. The effect was also evident in people whose diets were high in folate. Vegetables like spinach and broccoli and fruits like oranges are high in folates. While folate did not appear helpful, vitamin B12 in higher doses was linked with a slower decline in mental functioning. Monthly jab for alcoholicsJust once-a-month injection of the drug naltrexone can help treat alcohol dependance, claims a study in reported in the Journal Of American Medical Association. The use of the drug to treat alcoholism is not unknown, but adherence to a daily dose has been problematic. Alcohol dependence is a major public health problem around the world which contributes to more than 100,000 preventable deaths. The once-a-month injection of the medication tested at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill found that the long-acting version of the drug is as effective ? if not more ? as the daily dose. In addition, it takes care of the discontinuation of the drug which is considered more harmful for heavy drinkers.  Thrill-seekers put off women Reckless behaviours like bungee-jumping, river-rafting or skateboarding are usually associated with machismo. But such risky stunts hardly impress women looking for mates, says a report in the Evolution and Human Behaviour. From an evolutionary perspective it seems pointless to women who perceive risk-takers as irresponsible husbands."
Help for alcohol addicts in Shillong, By Our Correspondent in Shilong  ,  22/02/2016 ,"There is a candle in every soul/Some brightly burning some dark and cold/There is a spirit who brings the fire/Ignites a candle and makes his home/Carry your candle run to the darkness/Seek out the hopeless confused and torn/Hold out your candle for all to see it/Take your candle and go light your worldShillong, Feb. 21: The lyrics from the song echoed at the Don Bosco Youth Centre last evening as women, men, spiritual leaders and medical practitioners gathered to share their ideas on how to ""seek out the hopeless confused and torn"" and to bring ""light"" to their gloomy world.It was an evening which led to the formation of the Shillong Women's Fellowship under the Alcoholics Anonymous programme - a first of its kind in the Northeast.The public information programme on ""Women for Sobriety. A Challenge in Northeast India"" witnessed sharing of ideas and testimonies to encourage women - who are battling alcoholism - to seek support.""As an alcoholic, I felt that I was on the verge of dying. But I lived because of divine intervention,"" a woman told the gathering.The Delhi-based woman narrated her story from feeling abandoned to step-motherly treatment and from denial to how she gained sobriety through ""higher power"".She was accompanied by a few other women from Delhi and Mizoram.""I knew a darkness in my being; I felt death. But the higher power kept me alive to spread the message. I have decided to put my best foot forward to help others,"" the woman said.Stating that the programmes under Alcoholics Anonymous had come to her rescue, she said the programmes were ""very successful"".Father Joseph H. Pereira, founder of Kripa Foundation - which is devoted to care, support and rehabilitation of those affected by chemical dependency and HIV/AIDS - advocated for a ""holistic""? model to help those who are afflicted with alcoholism.Chemical dependency is often used as a term interchangeably with substance abuse.""There is a denial syndrome about the disease (alcoholism). For a woman alcoholic, it is even more difficult,"" Fr Pereira said.He added that 1,600 men have come to seek help from the Kripa centre in Shillong in the past 21 years since the centre was established. During the same period there were only around 20 women who had approached the centre for help, he said.""There are so many people who are afflicted with the disease. Many had died, but the shame syndrome continues. Do not be afraid or ashamed,"" Fr Pereira said.Stating that there was no ""chemical solution for chemical dependency"", he said the ""medical model"" has ""totally failed"".He, therefore, asserted the need for a ""holistic method"" like the Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) method, which is based on a 12-step programme.""There is nothing more powerful than the AA method,"" he said, adding that if one has gained sobriety, one cannot keep it to himself/herself, but will instead share the experience with others.The chairman of the general service board of Alcoholics Anonymous India, Harsh Udavat, pointed out that heavy alcohol consumption is more risky for women than for men.""Alcoholism is a progressive disease and there is no cure for it,"" Udavat who is also a gastroenterologist based in Jaipur, said.In its report released last year, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development pointed out that during 1992-2012, per capita consumption of alcohol in India has increased by 55 per cent which is the third-highest increase in the world.Moreover, the World Health Organisation has stated that while 30 per cent of Indians consume alcohol, around 4-13 per cent of them are daily consumers and up to 50 per cent of these fall under the category of hazardous drinking.Convener of yesterday's programme Sister Rose Paite who is also a trustee member of the general service board of Alcoholics Anonymous India, said it is still a challenge to help women who are into alcoholism.""Parents would like to spend much on sons, but when it comes to daughters, they say they do not have money,"" she said.While stating that women do not have access to treatment facilities, Sister Paite pointed out that the problem was ""severe"".She said it was time for women in the region to join Alcoholics Anonymous programmes.Under the Shillong Women's Fellowship, it was decided that recovery meetings would be held on Tuesdays and Thursdays at the Don Bosco Youth Centre from 4pm to 5.30pm.While there are no fees for AA membership, only an honest desire to rid the addiction is required."
Guideline flout cloud on HRD ministry, By Basant Kumar Mohanty ,  30/05/2015 ,"New Delhi, May 29: The human resource development ministry appears to have breached a Central Vigilance Commission guideline in forwarding an anonymous complaint to IIT Madras, which has led to a student group being controversially derecognised for criticising the Narendra Modi government.The IIT today cited its own rules, apparently set by student representatives themselves, to defend this week's action against the Ambedkar-Periyar Study Circle, most of whose 40-odd members are Dalits, amid charges of ""stifling free speech"" and caste discrimination. The ministry too issued a statement denying any role in the institute's action, stressing it had only forwarded the complaint and sought ""comments"".But the forwarded complaint had a hand-written line by an unnamed official saying: ""Unfortunate. IITs were never used for such purposes. Pl get comments.""The decision to forward an anonymous complaint after adding a judgmental noting suggests the meddling mindset that has marked the ministry over the years is immune to regime changes.An official wondered whether the IIT would have acted at all without the prod that became a thinly veiled nudge to crack down once the word ""unfortunate"" was added.Several government officials said the ministry's move of forwarding the complaint itself flouted a Central Vigilance Commission circular, issued on November 25 last year.""No action should be taken on anonymous/pseudonymous complaints,"" the circular, of which this newspaper has a copy, tells ministries and government departments. The officials confirmed that anonymous complaints were as a rule not given any attention.The commission had issued the same direction in 1999 before modifying it in 2002, saying such complaints might be looked into if they contained verifiable facts. Last November's order withdrew the 2002 amendment.The study circle had last month distributed a pamphlet castigating the Centre's ""Hindutva agenda"" with references to the cow slaughter ban and ghar wapsi programmes, and accusing it of helping multinationals ""loot Mother India"".This prompted an anonymous letter to the ministry by ""students, IIT Madras"", which accused the study circle of spreading ""hatred"" against Modi and Hindus and trying to ""polarise the ST, SC students"".On May 15, ministry undersecretary Prisca Mathew forwarded the complaint to the IIT Madras director, seeking ""comments"" by an early date. The letter referred to ""distribution of controversial posters and pamphlets in the campus... and creating hatred atmosphere among the students"".A ministry release said: ""Ministry of HRD has nothing to do with this except for forwarding the complaint... for comments. IIT Madras has taken action as per their own procedure and institute's guidelines.""Speaking to this newspaper in Assam's Silchar, HRD minister Smriti Irani stressed that IIT Madras was ""an autonomous body"" and had taken its own decision.""I know the people in the Congress are interested in finding flaws in the HRD (ministry), but I hope they understand that autonomous institutions have the right to administer their institutes according to their own laws,"" she said.Although the complaint and the ministry letter focused on the anti-Modi and allegedly anti-Hindu content of the pamphlet, IIT Madras highlighted only procedural violations by the student group.The IIT said the study circle had flouted guidelines for student groups ""desiring to use the institute's resources"".""The guidelines prescribe that student bodies are not allowed to use the institute's name or (that of) any of its official entities... to publicise their activities or garner support without official approval (from the dean),"" an IIT release said.It said the study circle would be able to present its defence on August 1 before the IIT's student representatives, who'll take the final decision.Irani's ministry has a reputation for meddling in the affairs of autonomous institutions.In October, it had asked all the IITs to look into a lone citizen's petition seeking separate dining halls for vegetarian and non-vegetarian students at their hostels. The ministry's alleged high-handedness is said to have forced the resignations of an IIT chairperson and an IIT director.Last year, the ministry had got the higher education regulator to arm-twist Delhi University into scrapping its four-year undergraduate programme. It's now pushing all the central universities to introduce a new credits system without taking the teachers on board.As for the Central Vigilance Commission circular on anonymous complaints, an official clarified that it was not necessarily a deterrent to whistleblowers.He said that while whistleblowers needed to reveal their identities before the authority they were complaining to, they could do so on a separate sheet with a request not to be identified.Additional reporting by G.C.

Mislead finger at Shopian cop - Constable accused of writing anonymous letter hinting at family's involvement, By OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT ,  16/12/2009 ,"Srinagar, Dec. 15: As if the chargesheet wasn’t explosive enough, a letter bomb has burst into the open.A Kashmir police constable has been accused of trying to “mislead” the probe into the alleged Shopian rape and murder case by hinting in an anonymous letter at the involvement of the family of the two victims.CBI sources said investigations found the constable wrote the letter asking police to probe the role of the family of Neelofar, 22, and her sister-in-law Asiya, 17, for the alleged May 29 murders that had triggered violent protests by residents who blamed security forces. The revelation came along with the report the CBI submitted to the high court yesterday which claimed Neelofar and Asiya were not murdered but had drowned in a stream in their town Shopian, 50km from Srinagar.The 66-page chargesheet-cum-report indicted 13 persons — among them doctors, lawyers and civilians — for fabricating evidence to prove that the two women were raped before being killed. Five police officers, including then Shopian police chief Javed Iqbal, who were earlier arrested for “destroying evidence”, were exonerated. The report sent ripples of anger across the Valley, with residents alleging a “clear cover-up”.A CBI officer said the letter was written by constable Mohd Yaseen Ganie to “divert” the probe.“The constable has been prosecuted under sections 203 and 211 of the Rambir Penal Code (the state’s equivalent of the Indian Penal Code), which are non-cognisable (less serious),” the officer added.The officer said the letter was supposedly written by a classmate of Asiya claiming that he was in love with her and that her family eliminated the girl as they disapproved of the relationship.The writer, who asked the police to investigate the family’s role in the alleged murders, claimed that he met Asiya and Neelofar on May 29 at a nearby orchard.“We were spotted by Shakeel (Asiya’s brother), prompting the two women to run away from the area,” the letter said.Sources said the local police station received the letter after the 47-day protests, which erupted in the town after the bodies of Asiya and Neelofar were fished out of the stream, had ended.“Now that it has been established that they were not murdered, how can the family be involved in it,” the CBI officer said.The CBI complaint said the letter was meant to “mislead/divert” the investigation“The handwriting expert of the Forensic Science Laboratory Srinagar has attributed the authorship of this letter to Constable Mohd Yaseen Ganie No. 538/SPN, who had written the said letter to mislead/divert the investigation from its logical conclusion,” the CBI said."
Dial 'D' in distress, By ONTHESPOT - COUNSELLING CENTRES ,  7/04/2009 ,"Naseeruddin Shah is a familiar face for most Metro commuters. His unmistakable drawl reaches out to people living on the edge, exhorting them to seek help and guidance. The veteran actor endorses Lifeline Foundation, where people find acceptance irrespective of their religion, caste, creed or social status. Apart from Lifeline, there are two other centres in south Calcutta offering succour to cope with the stress of modern day living. While Lifeline helps out those mentally distressed, Society for Nature, Education and Health (SNEH) reaches out to students and Alcoholics Anonymous to those with a drinking problem. Lifeline Foundation began 12 years back as a Calcutta centre for Befrienders Worldwide in England. It is one among the 14 centres that operated from various cities in India. Befrienders Worldwide has been helping those who are distressed and need someone to talk to and Lifeline Foundation is its Indian counterpart. Members of the foundation lend a sympathetic ear to those who call. They do not offer advice or take any decision on behalf of the callers. “All we try to do is to talk to them and let them unburden their problems. That helps clear their minds and think better,” said Jayshree Shome, a senior member of Lifeline Foundation. Beside, the members maintain strict confidentiality of all callers. “We do not ask for telephone numbers or addresses,” said Shome. The callers come from all walks of life. They are homemakers, working women and men and even criminals who confess to ease their conscience. But it is sometimes difficult to find volunteers for the centre. Those who work here need not always put in the entire day. “We have people who come in the afternoon and put in some hours to take calls,” said Shome. Though the main centre is at Mudiali, there are other counters of Lifeline Foundation at Lalbazar and Alipore Bodyguard Lines. “We want to make this a 24x7 helpline. However, we need more volunteers for that,” said Suksham Singh, the director of Lifeline Foundation. In 1996, SNEH started after the previous year saw the highest number of student suicides in the city. SNEH started counselling students in schools. “At the time, there were no counselling centres in Calcutta,” said Suvarna Ghosh, a senior member of SNEH. “We first approached schools and were turned away. However, we kept working at it and also got a license from the education department of the central government,” she added. They started with group counselling programmes at schools. “Children were too shy to talk at first. We needed to interact with them to understand their problems and that is where group counselling helped,” she said. They are presently working in about 24 schools in Calcutta and 12 schools in Barasat and Madhyamgram. The students’ problems are mostly rooted at home. Quarrelling parents, performance pressure, broken homes often drive them to depression. “Parents are often found quarrelling with each other even on their way to their children’s counselling centre,” said Ghosh. Fear of exams is also a common phobia. “We find most children are nervous before exams. We try to help by making a study plan and asking them to follow that,” said Ghosh. Alcoholics Anonymous is the oldest of the three, operating since 1983 in the city. It is a society for alcoholics who want to get rid of their addiction. Most of them have disturbed lives, broken homes, are unemployed and sick in the mind and body. A doctor and a sharebroker joined hands to start Alcoholics Anonymous in the US way back in 1935. Both were alcoholics who wanted to get rid of their addiction. They talked to each other and found that they could slowly let go. Now their effort has found place all over the world. The members here are not trained counsellors but people who share their experiences with those looking for help. “We have 12 steps and 12 traditions that we share with them,” said Debashish of Alcoholics Anonymous. Open meetings are held at different parts of the city where people with the same problem gather to talk. “We also meet members of the family so they understand how to handle these people at home,” said Debashish.

"Focus now shifts to aconite poisoning- Anonymous man with South Asian accent tips off police, says report", By THE SUNDAY TELEGRAPH & AGENCIES in London  ,  2/04/2007 ,"Kingston/London: Police investigating Bob Woolmer’s death have received a tip-off that the coach was poisoned by ‘aconite’, believed to be the “perfect” drug to mask a murder.According to a British newspaper, an anonymous man, thought to be from Pakistan, phoned police claiming that aconite killed the coach, following which Jamaica’s deputy commissioner of police Mark Shields, who is leading the probe, has ordered new tests on Woolmer’s body to look for traces of the drug.Aconite causes the victim’s internal organs to seize and slows down their breathing until they finally stop. Death is usually by asphyxiation within 30 minutes and this may explain how the 16-stone Woolmer died without putting up a fight.“The aconite tip is a major breakthrough and is being taken extremely seriously. The man who called Kingston police station had a South Asian accent and was very specific about aconite and how it was administered,” Shields was quoted as saying by the daily.“The symptoms Bob suffered before he died are identical to aconite poisoning, which is why it is a major line of inquiry now. It would also explain how such a physically imposing man, 6ft 1in tall, died without putting up a fight. You’d struggle to get two people into his bathroom let alone three, so it could be no-one was there,” he added.Toxicologists say aconite is the “perfect” drug to mask a murder. It also explains why Jamaican pathologist Dr Ere Sheshaiah found no marks around his neck to suggest he had been strangled.Toxicologist Prof John Henry of St Mary’s Hospital, Paddington, said that “Woolmer would have felt nauseous after the drug began to work and would have gone to the bathroom to be sick. He wouldn’t have realised straight away how serious his condition was, so it was doubtful he’d have phoned the reception.“By the time he realised how ill he was it would be too late... The drug causes a loss of power in the limbs. Aconite works like cyanide... It also causes vomiting and diarrhoea... All the while the victim’s mind remains clear, so it is a cruel death.“It is the perfect drug to make a murder appear to be a suicide because it leaves no mark on the body. It is difficult to detect in a post-mortem unless it was specifically looked for,” he said.Meanwhile, a Sunday Telegraph report adds that a blood-stained pillow found in Bob Woolmer’s room in the Jamaica Pegasus hotel, is the latest in a series of murder evidences. The pillow was soaked with blood at both ends, according to a Jamaican newspaper.Shields has refused to say what items were recovered from Woolmer’s room, saying certain details about the crime scene needed to be kept back to assist investigators.A Kingston pathologist concluded that the 58-year-old was strangled, but the lack of marks to his neck has led to theories that his killer, or killers, used a towel or item of clothing in the murder. Another British newspaper, meanwhile, said Woolmer feared harm by bookmakers since the 2000 match-fixing scandal broke. When a reporter asked him to move to a quieter place like his room for a chat, Woolmer reportedly said: “I feel more comfortable in public places.”Asked if he was worried about his safety, his replied “You don’t know how those people (bookmakers) will react” and added someone might be upset at the news (about match-fixing) and take it out on him.The paper also said Woolmer in his last interview had claimed to have rejected a £125,000-bribe to fix an international match in Mumbai in 1996 when he was South Africa’s coach.

Watch lifestyle & diet to keep liver healthy, By Subhajoy Roy in Sonarpur  ,  7/02/2018 ,"Sonarpur: Fatty liver diseases have been on the rise among non-alcoholics because of lifestyle and food habits and doctors warn ignoring early signs could lead to diseases that can kill.Doctors said there is no medicine yet to treat non-alcoholic fatty liver diseases (NAFLD) and the only way out is non-medicinal intervention such as lifestyle and dietary changes. Consuming non-junk and less sugary food and regular exercise, are some of the ways to arrest the condition.If the condition keeps worsening, fatty liver may even lead to cirrhosis and liver transplant may be needed to cure a patient. ""About 20 per cent of the global population has fatty liver, 60 per cent of them non-alcoholics,"" said Abhijit Chowdhury, the secretary of the West Bengal Liver Foundation and the man behind the Indian Institute of Liver and Digestive Sciences in Sonarpur.A doctor attending a symposium on non-alcoholic fatty liver diseases at the Sonarpur hospital said 10 years ago most of his patients with fatty liver were people who consumed alcohol. But now an increasing number of people who do not drink regularly are being diagnosed with the condition.""NAFLD is a benign stage of fatty liver but if ignored and allowed to worsen, it may lead to NASH. Further deterioration can cause cirrhosis when liver transplant may become necessary,"" said Andrew Peterson, the principal scientist of Genentech, a pharmaceutical company in the US.Chowdhury warned that India could become the global capital of NASH in future. ""Indians are genetically predisposed to fatty liver. Lifestyle and food habits add to this.""Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is reversible and timely intervention is essential, a doctor said."
Rinpas help to limit your pegs - Psychodrama therapy for alcoholics, By CHHANDOSREE ,  18/06/2013 ,"Remember Devdas? Anyone who is an alcoholic or a substance addict can’t be high on life, goes the basic premise. Ranchi Institute of Neuro-Psychiatry & Allied Sciences (Rinpas), Ranchi, has embarked on an innovative research on what makes them low. The premier institute treating individuals with psychological problems recently experimented with psychodrama therapy. Common in the west, it is an emerging field for psychiatrists in India.“Psychodrama therapy is a kind of role-playing in a group to help out patients,” Rinpas director Amool Ranjan told The Telegraph. “It’s effective to treat anxiety, depression and substance abuse, including alcohol addiction.” How does it work? Describing the technique, Rinpas expert Narendranath Samantaray said: “At first, we study the patient’s life-history. Then, a group of psychodrama experts enacts scenes from the person’s life before him, while he plays his own character. The process gets him to explore and express feelings he has buried or haven’t understood. Psychodrama gets to the root of his psychological problems due to loss or grief, resulting in depression, stress and alcoholism.”Samantaray added psychodrama was conducted on five persons — male, aged between 20 and 35 years, educated — who wanted a cure for alcoholism. “Each session usually lasts for two-three hours. Psychodramatists are trained specialists who know which part of the person’s life should be enacted. So, before a session, a warm-up with the group makes him feel good, relaxed and connect with experts who are playing characters from his life,” he added.A person may need 15 to 16 psychodrama sessions to free themselves from the clutches of addiction. How so? “There’s greater self-awareness to help a person deal with life without the bottle. While conducting research, psychodrama was found effective in dealing with managing conflicts related to family, interpersonal relationships, sex and concept of self. It was observed that all five patients made valiant efforts to combat their respective conflicts on their own,” Samantaray said.In the sessions, hidden truths, often traumatic, come out. For instance, one person accepted the fact that he felt guilty when his parents went bride-hunting for him, not knowing about his illicit relationship with his cousin, which spurred him to drink. Director Ranjan added Rinpas followed up on the five persons regularly to check the efficacy of psychodrama.“We keep in touch with the five. I am happy to report four out of five persons are absolutely free from addiction in the past two months. However, one has reported relapse,” Ranjan added.Will you recommend the psychodrama therapy?Tell ttkhand@abpmail.com"
BSF move to help alcoholic jawans, By OUR CORRESPONDENT ,  3/10/2013 ,"Guwahati, Oct. 2: The BSF has tied up with Alcoholics Anonymous, an NGO, to help its alcoholic personnel tide over bottle blues.As part of its effort, the Guwahati frontier of the BSF began a weeklong de-addiction programme for personnel at its Patgaon headquarters here today. “Alcohol addiction is a problem faced by many and BSF personnel are not an exception. About 1 per cent of our personnel on duty are reported to be engaged in heavy drinking, which is defined by five or more drinks daily on a regular basis,” S.K. Srivastava inspector-general of BSF’s Guwahati frontier, said.“Occasional drinking is also prevalent among around 35 per cent of the troops,” he said, while inaugurating the programme.Altogether 28 BSF personnel, who are suffering from alcohol addiction, participated in the programme conducted by counsellors from Alcoholics Anonymous.Srivastava blamed work-related stress, separation from family owing to posting in remote areas, as a measure to ward off the chill in high altitude areas like Jammu and Kashmir, availability of liquor at a highly subsidised price, are some of the reasons for alcoholism among the force.“Alcoholism often causes domestic violence, indiscipline in work, drunken brawls, financial drain, among others. We have seen how families are devastated owing to the problem,” Srivastava said. He said the BSF is planning to recruit its own counsellors, who will be trained by the NGO.According to him, alcohol addiction among security personnel causes indiscipline and also leads to incidents such as fragging. Srivastava said alcohol de-addiction would be a continuous process and not a one-off event.“We will take outmost care to preserve confidentiality for those seeking help in order to reduce the stigma attached to getting help and thus drawing more personnel suffering from alcoholism into this programme,” he said.Srivastava said alcohol addiction is a problem, which is not only confined to the security forces. “It has now become a social menace. Even in case of the Delhi gang rape incident, all the accused were under influence of alcohol,” he said.“In the BSF, we have stringent rules to deal with intoxication or alcoholism. A BSF jawan found to be intoxicated on duty may have to undergo rigorous imprisonment up to six months under Section 24 of BSF Act and Rules,” he added.He said the Guwahati frontier recently launched a helpline for its personnel to speak about their work-related problems and grievances.A now reformed BSF officer, who is second-in-command of a battalion posted in Dhubri sector, shared his experiences as an alcoholic and how he managed to quit drinking. Sister Rose from Alcoholics Anonymous said their basic aim was to help the persons suffering from alcoholism to lead a life of sobriety. “We are ready to help any alcoholic who has the slightest desire to kick the habit and lead a happy life,” she said."
"Bomb, letter threat to legislator", By R.N.

"Ghost caller resurfaces, threatens rural SP - Men in uniform fail to track anonymous person targetting police stations", By JOY SENGUPTA ,  15/09/2011 ,"Patna, Sept. 14: The mystery person, who called up Patna city superintendent of police (SP) (central) Shivdeep Lande and Patna district magistrate (DM) Sanjay Kumar Singh threatening them with dire consequences, has changed gears. With Lande returning to duty today after a 10-day leave, the man called up Patna rural superintendent of police Vivek Kumar, the acting city SP during Lande’s absence. The call came on Lande’s official mobile number on September 3, a day after the officer left for his leave. Today, the caller rang up on the landline number of Gandhi Maidan police station, which falls under Lande’s jurisdiction. The threat was the same again though this time, the calls originated from a different mobile number. Amid all the drama, the city police, who claim to crack tough cases, have not been able to make any breakthrough regarding the caller’s identity even after a fortnight. The police remain clueless about the anonymous caller who threatened the Patna DM on August 30. On August 27, claiming to be a Maoist area commander in Jamui, the caller had threatened to kill Lande on his official mobile number for showing excessive interest in the Kundan Singh case. Kundan, a dreaded criminal, now lodged in jail, is the primary accused in the murder of transporter Ravikant Choudhary on July 27. “Earlier, the calls were coming from mobile number 7654738472. There were more calls after the first one and with the caller switching off his phone every time after few seconds. It was difficult to nab him. The person had got the SIM after providing documents belonging to somebody else with a clean background. Before going on leave, I had given the official mobile number to the rural SP and he got a call on September 3 from another mobile number (8804950479),” Lande told The Telegraph. The police again checked the phone records and it was found that the caller had got the number after providing documents of the same person’s family member. “This time, he got the number against the name of the person’s father. But the photograph is the same. So we know that the caller is the same person,” the officer said. Moreover, the caller gave quite a few calls on the landline number of Kotwali and Pirbhore police stations. Police sources said they were still to trace the culprit. "

This is known as the 'blockchain'Bitcoins have to be 'mined' using specialist mining software, which then carries out a series of intensive calculations to find a certain data sequence, or 'block'. The block produces a specific data pattern when the bitcoin 'hash' algorithm is applied to the data. Whoever manages to do this will basically win bitcoins, which they can then spend in a range of places online and off.Source: Wired.co.uk"
"A NOBODY DIES - The Nehru-Gandhis apart, national heroes' kin are anonymous", By Ashok Mitra ,  19/12/2011 ," A formidable group of eminent scholars, extremely jealous of their liberal credentials, has emerged in the country. They take a charitable view of most men and matters. Their liberalism, however, gets frayed at the ends at the mention of Lefties, whom they consider to be a thoroughgoing useless lot. Since the Bengali academics they have met have happened to be of Left persuasion, they began taking a dim view of Bengal’s scholastic tradition, which was soon transformed into a generic Bengali baiting. Their close friends with Bengali surnames were spared, otherwise poking fun at every aspect of Bengali existence became a grand pastime. The Bengalis, in the reckoning of these eminences, are an embarrassing cargo the Indian nation has to carry. In support of their point of view, these eminences will cite the authority of the only great personality Bengal has accidentally produced, Nirad C. Chaudhuri. It should have been a bit of an inconvenience that while Chaudhuri enjoyed running down his fellow Bengalis, he was actually even more derisive of India and Indians. That however has not dampened the Bengaliphobes.For sure, these sage people have a case. Bengalis are often full of idiosyncrasies and angularities. They can be argumentative, cantankerous, clannish, verbose in their narratives with a tendency to make a mountain out of a molehill. They are, besides, most of the time over-emotional and waste an unconscionable length of time writing and hawking poetry. They have, in addition, developed the habit of idle pontification for hours on end in tea or coffee shop sessions. The typical Calcutta intellectual, who proudly announces that the title of the latest work by that what-is-his-name Latvian writer under the imprint of Gallimard is The percussion of supersonic and is greatly miffed when another friend in the adda claims to have already known about it, is particularly insufferable. Still, the poor Bengalis, it will have to be conceded, have at least one thing in their favour: they have stayed away from the bane of dynastic succession which threatens to overrun the rest of the country. ‘Follow the leader blindly’ is the nation’s motto. What the oldest political party, the Indian National Congress, thinks or does at once becomes an integral part of national political culture. If a member of the Congress falls foul of the party leadership, he or she is expelled for a period of six years. The rest of the parties in the country — barring the pestilent Left — which do not really belong — reverentially adopt the Congress norm: be it the Bharatiya Janata Party or the Muslim League, if an errant member is to be disciplined, he or she is chucked out for half-a-dozen years. Nobody ever questions why the duration of banishment has to be six years, not four or five or seven. Cheeky questions go ill with India’s heritage.The dynasty set up by Indira Gandhi — some will count it from Jawaharlal Nehru or even from his father, Motilal Nehru — is now generally accepted as part of the natural order. Is not India a democracy and a republic? So what: in the five millennia this nation has travelled through history, it has always felt comfortable under the protection of emperors and kings, Indians have the genius for adaptability, they can coalesce their concept of a republic with an ardour for royalty. Indian democracy will march from strength to strength even as its stewardship continues to rest with a Nehru-Gandhi for ever and ever; when the tenure of one N-G comes to a surcease, another N-G will take over. The norm set up at the Centre by the country’s leading party is followed by copycats in the states. Especially in this matter, Kashmir is, without any question, an inalienable part of India: from Sheikh Abdullah it has to be Farooq and on to Omar. In Punjab, it is from Papa Badal to Baba Badal; in Tamil Nadu, from M.K. Karunanidhi to M.K. Stalin; in Odisha from father Biju to son Naveen; in Bihar, from husband Yadav to housewife Yadav. Why waste space by adding further instances from other parts of the country?Strangely enough, Bengal has escaped the grasp of the epidemic. Consider the address 38/2 Elgin Road in south-central Calcutta. It was the residence of Subhas Chandra Bose. Almost diagonally across is the house his elder brother, Sarat Chandra Bose, built — the postal address is 1 Woodburn Park. These two addresses are witness to many historic meetings, parlays and confabulations during the nation’s struggle for freedom just as Anand Bhavan and Swaraj Bhavan in Allahabad have been. The sacrifices undergone by the Bose family in the cause of the country are no less — one dares say, perhaps more — than that of the Nehrus of Allahabad. The Nehru descendants have garnered the juicier fruits the tree of independence has been, and is, yielding. Even the great-great grandchild of Motilal Nehru is entitled to Z plus category security cover. The trajectory has been different for the Boses. They are nobodies. Now and then a scion of the family might have sought to get elected to the state assembly or Parliament. He or she has sometimes failed, sometimes succeeded. But these have been individual enterprises, the family has not at all come into the picture. Recently, a person with a professional background has been named a minister in a state administration; very few know — and fewer care — that he is a grandson of the Bose family; the Boses can here claim to be on par with the descendants of Mahatma Gandhi. A Gandhi grandson, Rajmohan, was in the Lok Sabha for a very brief spell; he got elected on the anti-Emergency wave, and not because he is a Gandhi. He soon withdrew to the tranquillity of university libraries. No other Gandhi has cared to walk the political catwalk, flaunting his or her pedigree. The Boses have behaved in a similar manner; they are now commoners, indistinguishable from the rest of the crowd. A nice quiet gentleman, yet to turn into the early eighties, died a fortnight ago in Delhi where he had lived on and off since the early 1950s. He, Pradip Bose, was a nephew of Subhas Chandra Bose. Nobody knew about it. He believed in his anonymity. Not that he was not interested in politics. Quite the contrary; politics was his obsession, but not any political activity which targets the capture of power. Pradip Bose’s focus was on the study of political ideology, particularly the ideology of the Left. He was a pure seeker of knowledge, keen to learn about the nuances of ideological postulates that influence the praxis of different parties professing to be on the Left. A convinced socialist, he had his own specific political philosophy. This he tucked within himself when calling on leaders and functionaries of various political formations, each claiming Marxist parentage. He was polite, soft-spoken, the gentlest of the gentle in framing his questions. When he would say thanks and withdraw, he would leave behind the image of a humble wanderer eager to cross fresh frontiers only for the purpose of gaining further insight, to know what lies on the other side, that is all, he does not want to intrude. While without any connections with any academic institution, Pradip nonetheless was scholar extraordinary. His stock of knowledge concerning political parties and political ideologies kept piling into a majestic mass. But he never flaunted it, just as he never dreamt of flaunting his pedigree. He developed a link with the Socialist International, spent years in Europe, Vienna, London and elsewhere, continuing his quest for distilled knowledge. He returned to Delhi, settled in, kept calling on famous and not so famous personages, always a modest smile lighting his lips and eyes, full of humility, but full of dignity too. The last occasion Pradip was in Calcutta, he was espied travelling from Jadavpur in the southern fringe of the city toward midtown in a jampacked ramshackle state transport corporation bus. A thought flashed across the mind of the acquaintance who spotted him. If only Pradip’s surname was not Bose, but Nehru-Gandhi, the special protection group would have cleared the bus of all other passengers; he would have travelled in lonely imperial splendour with crack Cobra sharpshooters hemming him in; the rest of the traffic would have been ordered to come to a dead halt. Pradip Bose died as he lived, quietly, apologetically, he had no intention of disturbing the agenda of others. And he died a nobody, he did not quite remember he was a nephew of Subhas Chandra Bose."
Battling bottle for 25 years, By Staff Reporter ,  7/08/2008 ,"Excessive drinking had almost ruined Dhruv (name changed) when he finally found the strength to set aside the bottle, thanks to a support group called the Alcoholics Anonymous (AA).Alcoholism — identified as a disease by the World Health Organisation — was once considered almost incurable. But it is much easier to kick the habit now with help from the AA programme, whose Calcutta chapter turns 25 this month.The programme started in the city in 1983 to help problem drinkers and currently has over 15 groups spanning Dum Dum to Behala. AA Calcutta has more than 400 active members from all walks of life, between the ages of 20 and 70 years.“As we expanded our activities in the city, doctors began referring patients to us. People also started looking up AA on the Internet and coming to our office on Nandan Street,” said a Calcutta AA spokesperson.The AA holds meetings across the city every evening at 7pm, “for the recovering alcoholics by the recovering alcoholics”. There is no membership fee. The programme relies on shared experiences and strengths of members and on the suggested 12 steps for recovery from alcoholism.“Alcoholism is like diabetes. Just like a diabetic can lead a fulfilling life by staying away from sugar, alcoholics can lead a normal life by foregoing one drink a day at a time,” the spokesperson said.Calcutta AA also holds meetings with the Border Security Force in West Bengal and the northeastern states, as well as with railway officials and police, to raise awareness about alcoholism and the AA.To celebrate its 25th year, Calcutta AA is organising a programme on September 27 and 28. “It will be attended by AA members from all over India and will help create greater awareness about AA,” said the spokesperson."
Help for women in recovery for sobriety, By Andrew W. Lyngdoh in Shilong  ,  9/02/2016 ,"Shillong, Feb. 8: A public information programme on ""women in recovery for sobriety"" will be held here next week where women who are recovering from alcoholism will share their stories with those in need of sobriety.The programme will be organised by the Shillong Chapter of the Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) along with Kripa Foundation, Shillong. It will deliberate on ""Women in Recovery for Sobriety: A Challenge in Northeast India"" at Don Bosco Youth Centre, Laitumkhrah.Speaking to The Telegraph, Sister Rose Paite, convener of the programme, said while men who desire to recover from alcoholism have better access to support systems, the same is not with women.""In the Northeast, there is a lot of stigma and discrimination attached with women who want to recover from alcoholism. They have no access to support systems unlike men,"" Sister Paite, who is also a trustee member of the general service board of AA India, said.At the same time, she pointed out that while there are several women in metropolitan cities and bigger towns in the rest of the country who are recovering from alcoholism because of the access they have to support systems, the same is absent in the Northeast.""Of course, they get treated in hospitals whenever they fall ill. But the accessibility to support systems to help them recover is lacking,"" Sister Paite said.While no study has been carried out to gauge the prevalence of women who are addicted to alcohol, she said alcoholism is generally not seen as a ""problem"" unlike drug addiction.In the past, various studies have been done across the board on the prevalence of drug addiction at different levels.""Although there is no data on the prevalence of alcoholism, the problem is huge. A study is required to have a thorough understanding of the issue,"" she said.She said the three-day public information programme would see participants from other states of the country where they would share their stories and ideas to help those who are craving to recover.Participants at Alcoholics Anonymous programmes follow 12 steps where constant interactions between those who wish to recover and those who have recovered take place."
Cops hit dead end on courier trail - Probe into parcel bomb focuses on repeated anonymous calls to victim, By OUR BUREAU ,  28/09/2012 ,"The person who delivered the parcel bomb that killed crime reporter and rights activist Chaitali Santra had most likely faked his identity as a courier company employee and made her sign an acknowledgement to look convincing, say investigators.A police scan of all courier franchisees in Howrah the day after Chaitali’s death revealed that none of them had any record of a consignment being delivered at 47/2 Dakshin Baksara, Lalkuthi, on Wednesday afternoon. “The person who delivered the bomb had apparently made Chaitali Santra sign an acknowledgement, as is the norm in the courier business. The victim had little reason to suspect he was not what he appeared to be,” an officer said.Chaitali, 40, was killed in the blast that occurred the moment she had unwrapped the parcel. Husband Himangshu, 48, suffered 80 per cent burns.The couple’s daughter Shatabdi, 18, was at a private tuition when the tragedy occurred. The teenager, who had a heart surgery as a child, put up a brave face in front of investigators who questioned her for several hours.“I have handed over each of my mother’s diaries to the police. She had been facing threats, but who could have thought that death would come this way?” said the student of journalism and mass communication at Asutosh College.With her father in hospital, neighbour Shanti Gharui has been Shatabdi’s support since the blast that tore her world asunder. “I have not been able to enter our house except once right after being informed about the incident. All my belongings are there, two nightdresses are all that I have with me,” she said.Madhumita Manna, the family’s domestic help for a decade, said she remembered only two occasions when parcels were delivered at the two-storey house. “Apart from telephone and electricity bills, we received parcels twice as far as I can remember. Bubai (Shatabdi’s pet name) had ordered something (a pen drive each from online shopping portal Flipkart) twice. The company called before delivering the packets on both occasions,” she said.Madhumita was on the first floor of the house when the blast occurred. “Dada-Boudi had just retired to their room after lunch. I hadn’t eaten…. I was waiting for Bubai to return from class. I was upstairs washing clothes when I heard the bell ring,” Madhumita recalled. “I asked ‘ke (who is it)?’. Boudi answered from the ground floor that there was a parcel and she was receiving it. I returned to the washroom.”Within minutes, she heard a bang and saw shards of glass fly.A team from the central forensic science laboratory is collecting samples. “The preliminary findings suggest the presence of ammonium nitrate in the explosive that caused the blast,” DGP Naparajit Mukherjee said at Writers’.A police team visited Westbank Hospital to speak to Himangshu but a few minutes of recorded conversation were all they got because of his condition.Chaitali used to be harassed by anonymous callers, her family members have told the police. The family of an engineer who had allegedly had a tiff with Chaitali after she helped his wife register a torture complaint against him has been questioned."
ICICI counters fresh plaint, By Our Special Correspondent in Mumbai  ,  23/06/2018 ,"Mumbai: ICICI Bank on Friday said it had received a complaint from an anonymous whistleblower in March about financial statements of the lender in earlier years.The complaint speaks of alleged irregularities in the conduct of a few accounts, leading to incorrect asset classification, overvaluation of security for corporate loans apart from incorrect accounting of interest income and bad loan recoveries.In a late evening statement to bourses, the private sector lender pointed out that following the complaint, an inquiry was carried out by the head of the internal audit group under the supervision of the audit committee.While the statutory auditors were provided periodic updates and their inputs were factored into the inquiry process, the interim report of the probe was reviewed in detail by the audit committee and statutory auditors, before the finalisation of the accounts for 2017-18.It said the findings of the interim report did not have any material impact on the financial statements for 2017-18.The anonymous complaint cited 31 loan accounts in which it said irregularities in some borrower accounts, resulting in incorrect asset classification was seen.The complaint added that there was incorrect accounting of interest income and NPA recoveries as fees. However, no specific examples were cited.The bank said with regard to the 31 accounts, the loans outstanding were fully classified as non-performing, with provisions made under applicable norms. These accounts were classified as non-performing between 2011-12 and 2016-17, other than two accounts which were classified by December 31, 2017.""Thus, all these loans had been classified as non-performing prior to the bank becoming aware of the complaint,"" the bank said.ICICI Bank, however, admitted that in certain accounts, transactions were observed that may have delayed the classification of the account as non-performing under Indian GAAP in earlier years."
Rehab clinic hope for addicts, By OUR CORRESPONDENT in Jamshedpur  ,  24/12/2007 ,"Jamshedpur, Dec. 23: Birsa Nagar resident Sourav (name changed) was a self-confessed alcoholic. When repeated attempts to stop hitting the bottle proved futile, he turned to Alcoholics Anonymous (AA).That was before 2003. After 2003 the AA unit here has been inactive. However, people like Sourav can now again hope for help from the organisation if they want to stop drinking. Things are looking up with people associated with the organisation turning up for the Friday evening meeting. “It’s good to see that some people (recovering alcoholics) have again begun showing interest in the meetings,” said an old member of AA. “An effort is on to reorganise by making people aware about the benefits of attending these meetings.”AA’s unit in Jamshedpur had not conducted a meeting since 2003. “Absence of committed people has affected the functioning of the AA here. While some people had left the city, others had died,” he said. The last time when those associated with AA had met was during a public information meeting organised at the Mumbai Chapter of AA in 2003. A person associated with AA said the organisation began operation in the city in 1998. The activities of AA and the messages it wants to communicate can be spread by work of mouth or through the police, doctors, media, hospitals and social organisations.“There are several alcoholics, who are not aware that such an organisation exists here,” said a member.But the going is not going to be easy. “Reorganising weekly meetings needs lots of effort and perseverance. One cannot force anybody to attend the meetings. There should be a desire to get rid of the addiction,” he said. AA programmes, according to the organisation’s website, operate by a recovering alcoholic passing along the story of his or her drinking problems, describing the sobriety found in AA, and inviting newcomers to join the informal fellowship. Though reviving AA was a hard task, said the member, they were confident of streamlining the process and getting it going. “We have begun contacting some old-timers. Messages can be spread through word of mouth. We are trying to send messages to as many alcoholics as possible. Perhaps this may do the tricks for us,” he added. AA members are generally identified by their first names, but the members talking to this correspondent requested not to be identified."
Pence denies writing piece, By New York Times News Service in Washington  ,  7/09/2018 ,"Washington: A day after a senior administration official described President Trump as amoral, impetuous, petty and ineffective in an anonymous essay, the denials from the upper echelon of the administration started to roll in.The mystery writer is not Vice-President Mike Pence, a spokesman said Thursday. ""Our office is above such amateur acts,"" the vice-president's spokesman, Jarrod Agen, said in a morning Twitter post, referring to the Op-Ed published on Wednesday in The New York Times.""It is not mine,"" Mike Pompeo, the secretary of state, said.""Patently false,"" said Dan Coats, the national intelligence director, responding to rumours that he or his principal deputy wrote the piece. ""We did not.""The author, whose identity is known to The Times editorial page department but was not shared with the reporters who cover the White House, describes him or herself as one of many senior officials in the Trump administration who are ""working diligently from within to frustrate parts of his agenda and his worst inclinations"".Since the piece was published, there has been a scramble to identify the anonymous official, prompting text analysis and speculation about motive."
"Take a break, or suffer burnout", By The Telegraph Online ,  30/03/2006 ,"New York, March 29 (Reuters): Sam used to sneak into his office before dawn so no one would know how many extra hours he worked. Charles goes on all-night work binges to meet deadlines and Susan can’t say no to volunteer projects, social clubs, bridge games, choral singing, lectures and classes.Each one is a member of Workaholics Anonymous, a 12-step recovery programme for compulsive workers based upon the structure of Alcoholics Anonymous (AA). Each one opted to keep their identity a secret.“It’s been called the addiction that society applauds,” said Mike, a physician and member of the group known as WA.“People brag about it and say, ‘I’m a workaholic,’” he said. “But workaholics burn out and then you’ve lost them or they become very dysfunctional and bitter and cynical in the organisation and corrosive.”Workaholics Anonymous keeps no central count of members, but organisers estimate dozens of weekly meetings are held in the US as well as in Germany, Switzerland, Austria and Britain. The group also sells about 100 books about WA a month via its website, according to organisers.WA’s roots go back to 1983, when a New York corporate financial planner and a school teacher founded a group based on AA but designed to fight compulsive working.WA identifies workaholics as people who often are perfectionists and worriers, derive their self-esteem from work, keep overly busy, neglect their health, postpone vacations and overschedule their lives.Workaholics don’t even have to have a job; they can just be compulsively busy as they seek an adrenaline high, to overcome feelings of inadequacy and low self-esteem and to avoid intimacy, it says.The weekly meeting in New York draws an average of a half dozen people in a city that might be considered a hotbed of workaholism. Such meagre attendance invites the predictable joke that most workaholics are too busy to attend meetings, a quip that organiser Charles has heard a million times.“People think it’s funny,” he said. “It’s amusing until you hear the stories. There have been many people who have come, and work is destroying their lives.”Unlike alcoholics, who can measure recovery by their days of sobriety, workaholics have no quantifiable gauge of their problem, or their recovery.“In my case, my boss was telling me I had to get my work hours down to 40 a week, and I couldn’t do it,” said Sam, a former senior project engineer in California’s Silicon Valley.“I was sneaking into work at 5 am on a Sunday so I could get work done and be out of the place before anyone else showed up,” he said. “I didn’t want people to see how much time I was putting in.“Now I’m more willing to try to do a mediocre job and keep my own mental health and sanity than to do the perfect job on everything I attempt,” he said.Like AA, WA uses a 12-step programme for recovery from addiction. At meetings, members share their experiences and study the organisation’s literature and guidelines.“It really forces you to look inside and say, ‘What’s really going on with me?’” said Charles. “A lot of people don’t want to do that.” "
Extortion letter warns judge of court blast, By Joy Sengupta in Patna  ,  23/08/2015 ,"Patna, Aug. 22: Pradeep Kumar Malik, the district and sessions judge of Buxar, around 150km west of Patna, has received an anonymous extortion letter.The letter that came through a regular government mail to the civil court yesterday, mentioned the name of one Soni Kumari, stating that the judge should ensure that an amount of Rs 10 lakh is delivered to her or else there would be an explosion in the court.Police have started investigations.""The letter has been written very shabbily and the same was forwarded to us today by the court. An FIR into this connection has been lodged at the Model police station and investigations have started. It can very well be a mischief but the police cannot take any chances and security has been beefed up at the residence of the judge as well as the civil court. The letter doesn't have any details of the sender but does have the name and complete address of whom to deliver the money to,"" Sunil Kumar, the sub-divisional police officer of Buxar, told The Telegraph.Sources said the address provided in the letter was verified and found to be true. ""The letter stated that the money had to be given to one Soni Kumari and her address was given. The police went to the same and found it to be true. She is a housewife and has claimed complete ignorance. Though the police too feel that she has got nothing to do with the incident, she and her family members have been questioned in detail. We are not ruling out enmity with another family over property/land. Soni's family had recently been in a quarrel with them over the same issue that they had threatened them of dire consequences within a week's time. It can very well be that the other family, in order to frame them, sent this letter. However, nothing concrete can be said at this moment and the other party will be questioned too. Until now, no one has been arrested,"" another officer said.Last week, threat letters were purportedly sent from the rebel militant group Islamic State (IS) to Munger commissioner Liyan Kunga and deputy inspector-general of police (Munger) S.P. Shukla.The police have claimed that they have identified the so-called mischief mongers involved in the act and arrests would be carried out."
